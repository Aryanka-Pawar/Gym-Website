# Gym-Website
This is a simple gym website which is made using basic concepts of HTML and CSS.
Here Internal method is used to incorporate CSS styling Sheet.
In this Project I used HTML template to form a design presenting fill-up form logos and buttons and used CSS to control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays.
A very basic project for self understanding and learning.
